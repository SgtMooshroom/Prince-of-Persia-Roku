Since I can't find any other way to do it, I'll make a Roku Port request here.

Please make a Roku Port of Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team. I want to have the option to be able to play this game on any smart TV, and a Roku port is clearly needed in this case.

I'll be getting a Roku TV soon, so please port it ASAP.
